        <h2>Student Biography</h2>
        <p>
            Before I decided to learn coding my work experience has been retail management and accounting. 
            Before I became a retail worker that led to my current accounting position I earned a degree in Theater Design and Tech. 
            While I have no experience in coding, every profession I have taken has prepared me for the challenges I will face ahead.
