            Before coding my work experience has been retail management, accounting, costume design and sewing for the Theater. 
            From 2007 to 2010, I was a student at St. Edwards University earning my degree in Theater Design and Tech. 
            While I have no experience in coding, every profession I have taken has prepared me for the challenges I will face ahead.
